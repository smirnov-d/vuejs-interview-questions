1.  ### What is VueJS?
    **Vue.js** is an open-source, progressive Javascript framework for building user interfaces that aim to be incrementally adoptable. The core library of VueJS is focused on the `view layer` only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

2.  ### What are the major features of VueJS?
    Below are the some of major features available with VueJS
    1. **Virtual DOM:** It uses virtual DOM similar to other existing frameworks such as ReactJS, Ember etc. Virtual DOM is a light-weight in-memory tree representation of the original HTML DOM and updated without affecting the original DOM.
    2. **Components:** Used to create reusable custom elements in VueJS applications.
    3. **Templates:** VueJS provides HTML based templates that bind the DOM with the Vue instance data
    4. **Routing:** Navigation between pages is achieved through vue-router
    5. **Light weight:** VueJS is light weight library compared to other frameworks.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

3.  ### What are the lifecycle methods of VueJS?
    Lifecycle hooks are a window into how the library you’re using works behind-the-scenes. By using these hooks, you will know when your component is created, added to the DOM, updated, or destroyed. Let's look at lifecycle diagram before going to each lifecycle hook in detail,

    <img src="https://github.com/sudheerj/vuejs-interview-questions/blob/master/images/vuelifecycle.png" width="400" height="800">

    1. **Creation(Initialization):**
        Creation Hooks allow you to perform actions before your component has even been added to the DOM. You need to use these hooks if you need to set things up in your component both during client rendering and server rendering. Unlike other hooks, creation hooks are also run during server-side rendering.
        1. beforeCreate:
           This hook runs at the very initialization of your component. hook observes data and initialization events in your component. Here, data is still not reactive and events that occur during the component’s lifecycle have not been set up yet.
        ```javascript
            new Vue({
              data: {
               count: 10
              },
              beforeCreate: function () {
                console.log('Nothing gets called at this moment')
                // `this` points to the view model instance
                console.log('count is ' + this.count);
              }
            })
               // count is undefined
         ```
        2. created:
            This hook is invoked when Vue has set up events and data observation. Here, events are active and access to reactive data is enabled though templates have not yet been mounted or rendered.
        ```javascript
          new Vue({
            data: {
             count: 10
            },
            created: function () {
              // `this` points to the view model instance
              console.log('count is: ' + this.count)
            }
          })
             // count is: 10
        ```
        **Note:** Remember that, You will not have access to the DOM or the target mounting element (this.$el) inside of creation hooks
    2. **Mounting(DOM Insertion):**
        Mounting hooks are often the most-used hooks and they allow you to access your component immediately before and after the first render.
        1. beforeMount:
            The beforeMount allows you to access your component immediately before and after the first render.
        ```javascript
          new Vue({
            beforeMount: function () {
              // `this` points to the view model instance
              console.log(`this.$el is yet to be created`);
            }
          })
        ```
        2. mounted:
            This is a most used hook and you will have full access to the reactive component, templates, and rendered DOM (via. this.$el).  The most frequently used patterns are fetching data for your component.
        ```javascript
        <div id="app">
            <p>I’m text inside the component.</p>
        </div>
          new Vue({
            el: ‘#app’,
            mounted: function() {
              console.log(this.$el.textContent); // I'm text inside the component.
            }
          })
        ```
    3. **Updating (Diff & Re-render):**
        Updating hooks are called whenever a reactive property used by your component changes, or something else causes it to re-render
        1. beforeUpdate:
        The beforeUpdate hook runs after data changes on your component and the update cycle begins, right before the DOM is patched and re-rendered.
        ```javascript
        <div id="app">
          <p>{{counter}}</p>
        </div>
        ...// rest of the code
          new Vue({
            el: '#app',
            data() {
              return {
                counter: 0
              }
            },
             created: function() {
              setInterval(() => {
                this.counter++
              }, 1000)
            },

            beforeUpdate: function() {
              console.log(this.counter) // Logs the counter value every second, before the DOM updates.
            }
          })
        ```
        2. updated:
            This hook runs after data changes on your component and the DOM re-renders.
        ```javascript
        <div id="app">
          <p ref="dom">{{counter}}</p>
        </div>
        ...//
          new Vue({
            el: '#app',
            data() {
              return {
                counter: 0
              }
            },
             created: function() {
              setInterval(() => {
                this.counter++
              }, 1000)
            },
            updated: function() {
              console.log(+this.$refs['dom'].textContent === this.counter) // Logs true every second
            }
          })
        ```
    4. **Destruction (Teardown):**
        Destruction hooks allow you to perform actions when your component is destroyed, such as cleanup or analytics sending.
        1. beforeDestroy:
        `beforeDestroy` is fired right before teardown. If you need to cleanup events or reactive subscriptions, beforeDestroy would probably be the time to do it. Your component will still be fully present and functional.
        ```javascript
        new Vue ({
          data() {
            return {
              message: 'Welcome VueJS developers'
            }
          },

          beforeDestroy: function() {
            this.message = null
            delete this.message
          }
        })
        ```
        2. destroyed:
        This hooks is called after your component has been destroyed, its directives have been unbound and its event listeners have been removed.
        ```javascript
        new Vue ({
            destroyed: function() {
              console.log(this) // Nothing to show here
            }
          })
        ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

4.  ### What are the conditional directives?
    VueJS provides set of directives to show or hide elements based on conditions. The available directives are: **v-if, v-else, v-else-if and v-show**
    
    **1. v-if:**  The v-if directive adds or removes DOM elements based on the given expression. For example, the below button will not show if isLoggedIn is set to false.
    ```javascript
    <button v-if="isLoggedIn">Logout</button>
    ```
    You can also control multiple elements with a single v-if statement by wrapping all the elements in a `<template>` element with the condition. For example, you can have both label and button together conditionally applied,
    ```javascript
    <template v-if="isLoggedIn">
      <label> Logout </button>
      <button> Logout </button>
    </template>
    ```
    **2. v-else:**  This directive is used to display content only when the expression adjacent v-if resolves to false. This is similar to else block in any programming language to display alternative content and it is preceded by v-if or v-else-if block. You don't need to pass any value to this.
    For example, v-else is used to display LogIn button if isLoggedIn is set to false(not logged in).
    ```javascript
    <button v-if="isLoggedIn"> Logout </button>
    <button v-else> Log In </button>
    ```
    **3. v-else-if:** This directive is used when we need more than two options to be checked.
    For example, we want to display some text instead of LogIn button when ifLoginDisabled property is set to true. This can be achieved through v-else statement.
    ```javascript
    <button v-if="isLoggedIn"> Logout </button>
    <label v-else-if="isLoginDisabled"> User login disabled </label>
    <button v-else> Log In </button>
    ```

    **4. v-show:** This directive is similar to v-if but it renders all elements to the DOM and then uses the CSS display property to show/hide elements. This directive is recommended if the elements are switched on and off frequently.
    ```javascript
    <span v-show="user.name">Welcome user,{{user.name}}</span>
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

5.  ### What is the difference between v-show and v-if directives?
    Below are some of the main differences between between **v-show** and **v-if** directives,

    1. v-if only renders the element to the DOM if the expression passes whereas v-show renders all elements to the DOM and then uses the CSS display property to show/hide elements based on expression.
    2. v-if supports v-else and v-else-if directives whereas v-show doesn't support else directives.
    3. v-if has higher toggle costs while v-show has higher initial render costs. i.e, v-show has a performance advantage if the elements are switched on and off frequently, while the v-if has the advantage when it comes to initial render time.
    4. v-if supports `<template>` tab but v-show doesn't support.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

6.  ### What is the purpose of v-for directive?
    The built-in v-for directive allows us to loop through items in an array or object. You can iterate on each element in the array or object.
    1. **Array usage:**
    ```javascript
    <ul id="list">
      <li v-for="(item, index) in items">
        {{ index }} - {{ item.message }}
      </li>
    </ul>

    var vm = new Vue({
      el: '#list',
      data: {
        items: [
          { message: 'John' },
          { message: 'Locke' }
        ]
      }
    })
    ```
    You can also use `of` as the delimiter instead of `in`, similar to javascript iterators.

    2. **Object usage:**
    ```javascript
    <div id="object">
      <div v-for="(value, key, index) of user">
        {{ index }}. {{ key }}: {{ value }}
      </div>
    </div>

    var vm = new Vue({
      el: '#object',
      data: {
        user: {
          firstName: 'John',
          lastName: 'Locke',
          age: 30
        }
      }
    })
    ```

7.  ### What is vue instance?
    Every Vue application works by creating a new Vue instance with the Vue function. Generally the variable vm (short for ViewModel) is used to refer Vue instance. You can create vue instance as below,
    ```javascript
    var vm = new Vue({
      // options
    })
    ```
    As mentioned in the above code snippets, you need to pass options object. You can find the full list of options in the API reference.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

8.  ### How do you achieve conditional group of elements?
    You can achieve conditional group of elements(toggle multiple elements at a time) by applying **v-if** directive on `<template>` element which works as invisible wrapper(no rendering) for group of elements.

    For example, you can conditionally group user details based on valid user condition.
    ```javascript
    <template v-if="condition">
      <h1>Name</h1>
      <p>Address</p>
      <p>Contact Details</p>
    </template>
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

9.  ### How do you reuse elements with key attribute?
    Vue always tries to render elements as efficient as possible. So it tries to reuse the elements instead of building them from scratch. But this behavior may cause problems in few scenarios.

    For example, if you try to render the same input element in both `v-if` and `v-else` blocks then it holds the previous value as below,
    ```javascript
    <template v-if="loginType === 'Admin'">
      <label>Admin</label>
      <input placeholder="Enter your ID">
    </template>
    <template v-else>
      <label>Guest</label>
      <input placeholder="Enter your name">
    </template>
    ```
    In this case, it shouldn't reuse. We can make both input elements as separate by applying **key** attribute as below,
    ```javascript
        <template v-if="loginType === 'Admin'">
          <label>Admin</label>
          <input placeholder="Enter your ID" key="admin-id">
        </template>
        <template v-else>
          <label>Guest</label>
          <input placeholder="Enter your name" key="user-name">
        </template>
    ```
    The above code make sure both inputs are independent and doesn't impact each other.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

10. ### Why should not use if and for directives together on the same element?
    It is recommended not to use v-if on the same element as v-for. Because v-for directive has a higher priority than v-if.

    There are two cases where developers try to use this combination,

     1. To filter items in a list

       For example, if you try to filter the list using v-if tag,

       ```javascript
         <ul>
           <li
             v-for="user in users"
             v-if="user.isActive"
             :key="user.id"
           >
             {{ user.name }}
           <li>
         </ul>
       ```
       This can be avoided by preparing the filtered list using computed property on the initial list
       ```javascript
         computed: {
           activeUsers: function () {
             return this.users.filter(function (user) {
               return user.isActive
             })
           }
         }
         ...... //
         ...... //
         <ul>
           <li
             v-for="user in activeUsers"
             :key="user.id">
             {{ user.name }}
           <li>
         </ul>
       ```
     2. To avoid rendering a list if it should be hidden

       For example, if you try to conditionally check if the user is to be shown or hidden

       ```javascript
         <ul>
           <li
             v-for="user in users"
             v-if="shouldShowUsers"
             :key="user.id"
           >
             {{ user.name }}
           <li>
         </ul>
       ```
       This can be solved by moving the condition to a parent by avoiding this check for each user
       ```javascript
         <ul v-if="shouldShowUsers">
           <li
             v-for="user in users"
             :key="user.id"
           >
             {{ user.name }}
           <li>
         </ul>
       ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

11.  ### Why do you need to use key attribute on for directive?
     In order to track each node’s identity, and thus reuse and reorder existing elements, you need to provide a unique `key` attribute for each item with in `v-for` iteration. An ideal value for key would be the unique id of each item.

     Let us take an example usage,
     ```javascript
     <div v-for="item in items" :key="item.id">
       {{item.name}}
     </div>
     ```
     Hence, It is always recommended to provide a key with v-for whenever possible, unless the iterated DOM content is simple.

     **Note:** You shouldn’t use non-primitive values like objects and arrays as v-for keys. Use string or numeric values instead.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

12.  ### What are the array detection mutation methods?
     As the name suggests, mutation methods modifies the original array.

     Below are the list of array mutation methods which trigger view updates.
     1. push()
     2. pop()
     3. shift()
     4. unshift()
     5. splice()
     6. sort()
     7. reverse()
     
     If you perform any of the above mutation method on the list then it triggers view update. For example, push method on array named 'items' trigger a view update,
     ```javascript
     vm.todos.push({ message: 'Baz' })
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

13.  ### What are the array detection non-mutation methods?
     The methods which do not mutate the original array but always return a new array are called non-mutation methods.

     Below are the list of non-mutation methods,
     1. filter()
     2. concat()
     3. slice()

     For example, lets take a todo list where it replaces the old array with new one based on status filter,
     ```javascript
     vm.todos = vm.todos.filter(function (todo) {
       return todo.status.match(/Completed/)
     })
     ```
     This approach won't re-render the entire list due to VueJS implementation.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

14.  ### What are the caveats of array changes detection?
     Vue cannot detect changes for the array in the below two cases,

     1. When you directly set an item with the index,For example,
        ```javascript
        vm.todos[indexOfTodo] = newTodo
        ```
     2. When you modify the length of the array, For example,
          ```javascript
          vm.todos.length = todosLength
          ```

     You can overcome both the caveats using `set` and `splice` methods, Let's see the solutions with an examples,
     
     **First use case solution**
     ```javascript
     // Vue.set
     Vue.set(vm.todos, indexOfTodo, newTodoValue)
     (or)
     // Array.prototype.splice
     vm.todos.splice(indexOfTodo, 1, newTodoValue)
     ```
     **Second use case solution**
     ```javascript
     vm.todos.splice(todosLength)
     ```

15.  ### What are the caveats of object changes detection?
     Vue cannot detect changes for the object in property addition or deletion.

     Lets take an example of user data changes,
     ```javascript
     var vm = new Vue({
       data: {
         user: {
           name: 'John'
         }
       }
     })

     // `vm.name` is now reactive

     vm.email = john@email.com // `vm.email` is NOT reactive
     ```
     You can overcome this scenario using the Vue.set(object, key, value) method or Object.assign(),
     ```javascript
     Vue.set(vm.user, 'email', 'john@email.com');
     // (or)
     vm.user = Object.assign({}, vm.user, {
       email: john@email.com
     })
     ```

16.  ### How do you use v-for directive with a range?
     You can also use integer type(say 'n') for `v-for` directive which repeats the element many times.
     ```javascript
     <div>
       <span v-for="n in 20">{{ n }} </span>
     </div>
     ```
     It displays the number 1 to 20.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

17.  ### How do you use v-for directive on template?
     Just similar to v-if directive on template, you can also use a `<template>` tag with v-for directive to render a block of multiple elements.

     Let's take a todo example,
     ```javascript
     <ul>
       <template v-for="todo in todos">
         <li>{{ todo.title }}</li>
         <li class="divider"></li>
       </template>
     </ul>
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

18.  ### How do you use event handlers?
     You can use event handlers in vue similar to plain javascript. The method calls also support the special $event variable.
     ```javascript
     <button v-on:click="show('Welcome to VueJS world', $event)">
       Submit
     </button>

     methods: {
       show: function (message, event) {
         // now we have access to the native event
         if (event) event.preventDefault()
         console.log(message);
       }
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

19.  ### What are the event modifiers provided by vue?
     Normally, javascript provides `event.preventDefault() or event.stopPropagation()` inside event handlers. You can use methods provided by vue, but these methods are meant for data logic instead of dealing with DOM events. Vue provides below event modifiers for v-on and these modifiers are directive postfixes denoted by a dot.
     1. .stop
     2. .prevent
     3. .capture
     4. .self
     5. .once
     6. .passive
     
     Let's take an example of stop modifier,
     ```html
     <!-- the click event's propagation will be stopped -->
     <a v-on:click.stop="methodCall"></a>
     ```
     You can also chain modifiers as below,
     ```html
     <!-- modifiers can be chained -->
     <a v-on:click.stop.prevent="doThat"></a>
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

20.  ### What are key modifiers?
     Vue supports key modifiers on `v-on` for handling keyboard events. Let's take an example of keyup event with enter keycode.
     ```html
     <!-- only call `vm.show()` when the `keyCode` is 13 -->
     <input v-on:keyup.13="show">
     ```
     Remembering all the key codes is really difficult. It supports the full list of key codes aliases
     1. .enter
     2. .tab
     3. .delete (captures both “Delete” and “Backspace” keys)
     4. .esc
     5. .space
     6. .up
     7. .down
     8. .left
     9. .right

     Now the above keyup code snippet can be written with aliases as follows,
     ```vue
     <input v-on:keyup.enter="submit" />
     <!-- OR with shorthand notation -->
     <input @keyup.enter="submit" />
     ```

     **Note:** The use of keyCode events is deprecated and may not be supported in new browsers.

26.  ### What are components and give an example?
     Components are reusable Vue instances with a name. They accept the same options as new Vue, such as data, computed, watch, methods, and lifecycle hooks(except few root-specific options like el).

     Lets take an example of counter component,
     ```javascript
     // Define a new component called button-counter
     Vue.component('button-counter', {
       template: '<button v-on:click="count++">You clicked me {{ count }} times.</button>'
       data: function () {
         return {
           count: 0
         }
       },
     })
     ```
     Let's use this component inside a root Vue instance created with new Vue
     ```javascript
     <div id="app">
       <button-counter></button-counter>
     </div>

     var vm = new Vue({ el: '#app' });
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

27.  ### What are props?
     Props are custom attributes you can register on a component. When a value is passed to a prop attribute, it becomes a property on that component instance. You can pass those list of values as props option and use them as similar to data variables in template.
     ```javascript
     Vue.component('todo-item', {
       props: ['title'],
       template: '<h2>{{ title }}</h2>'
     })
     ```
     Once the props are registered, you can pass them as custom atrtributes.
     ```vue
     <todo-item title="Learn Vue conceptsnfirst"></todo-item>
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

28.  ### When component needs a single root element?
     Every component must have a single root element **when template has more than one element**. In this case, you need to wrap the elements with a parent element.
     ```vue
     <div class="todo-item">
       <h2>{{ title }}</h2>
       <div v-html="content"></div>
     </div>
     ```
     Otherwise there will an error throwing, saying that "Component template should contain exactly one root element...".

29.  ### How do you communicate from child to parent using events?
     If you want child wants to communicate back up to the parent, then emit an event from child using `$emit` object to parent,
     ```javascript
     Vue.component('todo-tem', {
       props: ['todo'],
       template: `
         <div class="todo-item">
           <h3>{{ todo.title }}</h3>
           <button v-on:click="$emit('increment-count', 1)">
             Add
           </button>
           <div v-html="todo.description"></div>
         </div>
       `
     })
     ```
     Now you can use this todo-item in parent component to access the count value.
     ```vue
     <ul v-for="todo in todos">
       <li>
         <todo-item
           v-bind:key="todo.id"
           v-bind:todo="todo"
           v-on:increment-count="total += 1"
         /></todo-item>
       </li>
     </ul>
     <span> Total todos count is {{total}}</span>
     ```

30.  ### How do you implement model on custom input components?
     The custom events can also be used to create custom inputs that work with v-model. The `<input>` inside the component must follow below rules,

     1. Bind the value attribute to a value prop
     2. On input, emit its own custom input event with the new value.

     Let's take a custom-input component as an example,
        ```javascript
        Vue.component('custom-input', {
          props: ['value'],
          template: `
            <input
              v-bind:value="value"
              v-on:input="$emit('input', $event.target.value)"
            />
          `
        })
        ```
     Now you can use `v-model` with this component,
      ```vue
      <custom-input v-model="searchInput"></custom-input>
      ```

31.  ### What are slots?
     Vue implements a content distribution API using the <slot> element to serve as distribution outlets for content created after after the current Web Components spec draft.

     Let's create an alert component with slots for content insertion,
     ```javascript
     Vue.component('alert', {
       template: `
         <div class="alert-box">
           <strong>Error!</strong>
           <slot></slot>
         </div>
       `
     })
     ```
     Now you can insert dynamic content as below,
     ```vue
     <alert>
       There is an issue with in application.
     </alert>
     ```

32.  ### What is global registration in components?
     The components which are globally registered can be used in the template of any root Vue instance (new Vue) created after registration.

     In the global registration, the components created using Vue.component as below,
     ```javascript
     Vue.component('my-component-name', {
       // ... options ...
     })
     ```
     Let's take multiple components which are globally registered in the vue instance,
     ```javascript
     Vue.component('component-a', { /* ... */ })
     Vue.component('component-b', { /* ... */ })
     Vue.component('component-c', { /* ... */ })

     new Vue({ el: '#app' })
     ```
     The above components can be used in the vue instance,
     ```vue
     <div id="app">
       <component-a></component-a>
       <component-b></component-b>
       <component-c></component-c>
     </div>
     ```
     Remember that the components can be used in subcomponents as well.

33.  ### Why do you need local registration?
     Due to global registration, even if you don't use the component it could still be included in your final build. So it will create unnecessary javascript in the application. This can be avoided using local registration with the below steps,
     1. First you need to define your components as plain JavaScript objects
         ```javascript
         var ComponentA = { /* ... */ }
         var ComponentB = { /* ... */ }
         var ComponentC = { /* ... */ }
         ```
         Locally registered components will not be available in sub components. In this case, you need to add them in components section
         ```javascript
         var ComponentA = { /* ... */ }

         var ComponentB = {
           components: {
             'component-a': ComponentA
           },
           // ...
         }
         ```
     2. You can use the components in the components section of the vue instance,
         ```javascript
         new Vue({
           el: '#app',
           components: {
             'component-a': ComponentA,
             'component-b': ComponentB
           }
         })
         ```

47.  ### What are single file components?
     Single File Components are an easy concept to understand. Earlier you might heard about all three parts(HTML, JavaScript and CSS) of your application kept in different components. But Single File Components encapsulate the structure, styling and behaviour into one file. In the beginning, it seems strange to have all three parts in one file, but it actually makes a lot more sense.

     Let's take an example of Singile File Components
     ```vue
     <template>
       <div>
         <h1>Welcome {{ name }}!</h1>
       </div>
     </template>
     
     <script>
     module.exports = {
       data: function() {
         return {
           name: 'John'
         }
       }
     }
     </script>
     
     <style scoped>
     h1 {
       color: #34c779;
       padding: 3px;
     }
     </style>
     ```

50.  ### What are filters?
     Filters can be used to apply common text formatting. These Filters should be appended to the end of the JavaScript expression, denoted by the “pipe” symbol. You can use them in two specific cases:
     1. mustache interpolations
     2. v-bind expressions

     For example, Let's define a local filter named capitalize in a component’s options
     ```javascript
     filters: {
       capitalize: function (value) {
         if (!value) return ''
         value = value.toString()
         return value.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + value.slice(1)
       }
     }
     ```
     Now you can use the filter in either mustache interpolation or v-bind expression,
     ```vue
     <!-- in mustaches -->
     {{ username | capitalize }}

     <!-- in v-bind -->
     <div v-bind:id="username | capitalize"></div>
     ```

92.  ### What is Dev Tools and its purpose?
     DevTools is a browser extension allowing you to inspect and debug your Vue applications in a more user-friendly interface. You can find the below extensions for different browsers or environments,
     1. Chrome Extension
     2. Firefox Addon
     3. Standalone Electron app (works with any environment)

     The DevTools plugins can be used as shown in the below snapshot,

     <img src="https://github.com/sudheerj/vuejs-interview-questions/blob/master/images/DevTools.png" width="700" height="500">

     **Note:**
     1. If the page uses a production/minified build of Vue.js, devtools inspection is disabled by default so the Vue pane won't show up.
     2. To make it work for pages opened via `file://` protocol, you need to check "Allow access to file URLs" for this extension in Chrome's extension management panel.

93.  ### What is the browser support of VueJS?
     It supports all ECMAScript5 complaint browsers as mentioned in this [url](https://caniuse.com/#feat=es5). VueJS doesn't support IE8 browser and below, because it uses ECMAScript 5 features that are un-shimmable(require support from the underlying JS engine) in IE8.

94.  ### How do you use various CDNs?
     VueJS is available in jsdelivr, unpkg and cdnjs etc CDNs. Normally you can use them for prototyping or learning purposes.

     For example, you can use them using jsdelivr with latest versions as below,
     ```javascript
     <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.6.7/dist/vue.js"></script>
     ```
     You can use it for native ES modules as below,
     ```javascript
     <script type="module">
       import Vue from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.6.7/dist/vue.esm.browser.js'
     </script>
     ```

     **Note:** You can remove version number to get latest version.

121. ### How do you use hot reloading?
     The vue loader plugin internally uses hot reloading. If you are scaffolding project with `vue-cli`, hot reloading comes out of the box but if you are manually setting up the project then hot reloading is enabled by default with `webpack-dev-server --hot` command.

214. ### What is the main difference between method and computed property?
     The main difference between a computed property and a method is that computed properties are cached and invoke/change only when their dependencies change. Whereas a method will evaluate every time it's called.
